    <h1>Features &amp; Roadmap</h1>
    <h2>Broadcast Frequency: Echoes of the Fall</h2>

    <h3>What is Already Here</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Discord-native hands-off simulation:</b> Join the story by using /transmit and choosing your archetype. All actions and outcomes are fully simulated. Just watch as your survivor's journey unfolds.</li>
      <li><b>Persistent progress:</b> Vault inventory and survivor history are cloud-saved for every player. Items can outlive you and your legacy remains in the Zone.</li>
      <li><b>No manual control, no grind:</b> The simulation runs automatically, reporting every event, danger, and loot find directly to your Discord channel.</li>
      <li><b>Real-time automatic events:</b> Every tick something happens. Find loot, survive danger, heal, extract, or succumb to the Zone.</li>
      <li><b>Dynamic zone map:</b> Multi-layered map with sub-locations and increasing risk and reward the deeper you travel.</li>
      <li><b>Supplies and danger:</b> Supplies dwindle, injuries happen, and extraction is always a gamble. Every decision is made by the simulation.</li>
      <li><b>Corpse and epitaph system:</b> Dead survivors become lootable stories for others. Every death is logged and remembered.</li>
      <li><b>Archetypes:</b> Bandit, Hunter, Medic, Survivor. Each has unique event pools, risk and reward, and style.</li>
      <li><b>Inventory, loot, and equipment:</b> Hundreds of items. Auto-equipped and managed by the sim. Find, vault, or deliver for rewards.</li>
      <li><b>Signal strength and milestones:</b> Deliver rare signal items to boost your server's outpost and unlock new events. Signal decays over time. Keep it charged.</li>
      <li><b>Multi-server support:</b> Each Discord server is its own Zone with persistent player state and narrative history.</li>
      <li><b>Cloud save for all:</b> Survivor progress, inventory, and death records are saved and recoverable after restart or crash. No premium required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Development Roadmap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Archetype event gating:</b> Unique event pools, actions, and storylines for each archetype. Newbie shield for fresh survivors.</li>
      <li><b>Weighted archetype-driven movement:</b> Bandits, Medics, Hunters, and Survivors all travel the Zone differently. Organic weighted pathing, never railroaded.</li>
      <li><b>Event and encounter pool expansion:</b> More event templates, rare loot, combat, cross-archetype events, and narrative twists.</li>
      <li><b>Survivor history and legacy:</b> Expanded death logs, detailed epitaphs, and survivor cards tracking loot, achievements, and cause of death.</li>
      <li><b>Survival, injury, and healing upgrades:</b> Multi-stage danger, injury, death, and intervention events. Gear and event-driven survival modifiers.</li>
      <li><b>Inventory and loot rarity expansion:</b> Rare, legendary, and archetype or location-specific loot. More buffs, debuffs, and consumables.</li>
      <li><b>PVP engine:</b> Simulated PVP events. Attack, robbery, safe mode for new players, all handled by the simulation.</li>
      <li><b>NPC monster boss encounters:</b> Hostile wildlife, mutants, raiders, and more. With archetype and location-based odds.</li>
      <li><b>Map and event worldbuilding:</b> More zones, hotspots, rare event spawns, dynamic lore, and evolving zone states.</li>
      <li><b>Narrative and flavor expansion:</b> New milestone events, immersive text, and Discord shout-outs.</li>
      <li><b>Visuals, web portal, and community:</b> View survivor cards, leaderboards, and death logs on the web. Visual overlays and Discord UI upgrades are optional and modular.</li>
      <li><b>Premium and shared world:</b> Premium unlocks cross-server play, world migration, and epic global events. All core gameplay remains free.</li>
      <li><b>Security, polish, and scaling:</b> Config lockdown, error monitoring, backend optimization, and anti-tamper safeguards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>No Pay-to-Win. No Grind. Just Story.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No lootboxes, no microtransactions for survival or power.</li>
      <li>Premium is cosmetic, meta, or shared-world only. Never gameplay advantage.</li>
      <li>100 percent free during Alpha and Beta. Core game will always have a full-featured free version.</li>
    </ul>
